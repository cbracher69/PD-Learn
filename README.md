Project PD-LEARN
============

Analyze Data from a Large Parkinson's Clinical Study - a project in cooperation with <a href="http://www.zipfianacademy.com">Zipfian Academy</a> and <a href="www.bayesimpact.org">Bayes Impact</a>.

### Overview

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease">Parkinson's Disease</a> (PD) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease that has a significant prevalence in the general population:  About 1 in 300 people in the U.S. have PD, and about 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.  While there are medications that treat symptoms, the disease itself is incurable and invariably disables patients physically and mentally over time, leading to a high financial and societal burden on healthcare systems and caretakers.  Despite its prevalence, very little is known about the causes of PD, and possible cures remain a distant prospect.

PPMI, the <a href="http://www.ppmi-info.org/">Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative</a>, is a large scale, 60 million dollar study of Parkinson's Disease spearheaded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation.  PPMI is a longitudinal study of about 1,000 subjects that combines an extensive array of measurements of population, behavioral, neurological, clinical, imaging, and genetic traits, and follows their evolution over time, in the hope of finding markers that predict PD risk, and the course of the disease in individual patients.

### Project Goals

PPMI provides large amounts of data for dozens of independent, often disparate measurements, such as gender, education, olfactory ability, depression, mental ability, biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, genetic variants, and various forms of structural and functional imaging, that are in use to diagnose PD, or are suspected to play a role in the pathology of the disease.  Simple correlation studies between pairs of markers are incapable of extracting patterns hidden in this wealth of information.  Advanced statistical techniques like machine learning and pattern recognition promise to yield insights that cannot simply be gained from plotting the data.

This project aims to

* render the data set in a form that is easy to access and control, 
* apply machine learning techniques to elucidate hidden structure in the data,
* provide streamlined access to these methods to researchers not familiar with ML tools and their use, in order to advance exploration of PPMI data,
* evaluate biomarkers for their value in the diagnostics of PD, and to identify population groups at risk,
* establish whether there are distinct subgroups of patients that share the outward symptoms of PD, but differ in the underlying biological or environmental causes of the syndrome.
