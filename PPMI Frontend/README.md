PPMI Front-end
==============

Version 0.01 
(August 11, 2014)

Constructing a web-based user interface for "PD-LEARN," a framework that applies machine learning to PPMI data.

### Work in Progress

Currently, this is a mere "mock-up" of the future web interface that shows the design, but lacks most of the functionality of the front end.  While one can check checkboxes and radio buttons, the information is currently simply discarded.  Only the "Back," "Continue," and "Start Over" are functional, and switch between elements of the user interface.

To start, download the contents of the drawer in a single directory, and double-click on "ppmi-frontend pg1 0v01.html" (or drop this file into a browser window).
