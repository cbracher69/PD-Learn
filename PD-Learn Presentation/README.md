PPMI Presentations
==================

This folder contains a few presentations regarding work on the PPMI study done for Bayes Impact and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.

### Project PPMI Report

A fairly extensive report on work with PPMI data, composed together with Mijail Gomez (Zipfian Academy & Bayes Impact data science fellow).  It details some machine learning insights into the significance of different features of the PPMI study, illustrates a combination of easily accessible tests (olfactory ability, REM sleep behavior, self-reported motor difficulties) that is highly predictive for "classical" Parkinson's Disease and successfully distinguishes a variant ('SWEDD') that is misclassified by the current standard of testing, DaTSCAN (a brain imaging technique).

The report also highlights work on ideas to utilize the internet to further research and awareness into Parkinson's Disease: Mijail created a web app for users to self-assess their risk of Parkinson's based on questions about their motor performance.  I present a prototype of an expert system that gives life science researchers a more intuitive way to apply machine learning techniques to PPMI data via a web interface.

### PD-LEARN

A brief three-minute presentation at Zipfian Academy that gives an overview about Parkinson's Disease and its diagnosis, the structure of a machine learning framework for PD research, and some results obtained using that framework.
